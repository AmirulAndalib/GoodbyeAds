###There are two possibilities for blocking ads on YouTube:

1. Use **`GoodbyeAds-YouTube-AdBlock pack`**. In our test we are able to block 90% of ads. At the first starting you will see 1 or 2 ads, after that there will be no ads. There are mixed reports on its effectiveness, so our recommendation is to try it yourself and see if it works for you.

   Please note that homepage ads cannot be blocked, because it will break the entire app.

2. Use an alternative YouTube client, like **`NewPipe or YouTubeVanced`**. Both have pros and cons and there's no "best" one, so try them and use the one that better fits your needs.
