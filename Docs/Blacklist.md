## GoodbyeAds has several lists to chose. Some are specific and some are general purpose. There's no "best" one, but these are general guidelines:

- Start with the recommended list **`(GoodbyeAds)`**.

- If it's not blocking enough, go for more comprehensive lists **`GoodbyeAds-Ultra`**.

- Use Extension packs like *`GoodbyeAds-Xiaomi-AdBlock, Samsung-AdBlock, YouTube-AdBlock`* according to your device variant.

- GoodbyeAds lists are mutually inclusive so no need to select two of them *`(example: everything in GoodbyeAds is included in GoodbyeAds-Ultra).`*

- If you are using GoodbyeAds-Ultra , then you don't need to use extension seperatly. Extensions are included in the Ultra pack.

- After a little bit of trial select the list/s that fit your needs.
