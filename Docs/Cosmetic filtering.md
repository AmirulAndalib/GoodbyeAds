####Hiding the spaces that were supposed to contain an ad in webpages is called "cosmetic filtering". 

####Unfortunately, cosmetic filtering isn't possible using non-root adblockers like Blokada, DNS66 etc.
####If you want to have cosmetic filtering, we recommend to use an extensible browser and an ad blocking extension like abp, ublock origin or some other available for your browser of choice.
